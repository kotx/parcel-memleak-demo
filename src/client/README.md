# Tadaima client

- `npm start` — This will spawn a development server with a default port of `1234`.
- `npm run build` — This will output a production build in the `dist` directory.
- `npm run typecheck` — This will run `tsc --noEmit` which basically just typechecks your project.
- `npm run typewatch` — This will run `tsc --noEmit --watch` which will typecheck your project as you make changes.

## Typechecking

Unforunately, Parcel does not perform typechecking. So you will need to make use of the `typecheck` and `typewatch` scripts above.

## Custom port

You can use the `-p` flag to specify a port for development. To do this, you can either run `npm start` with an additional flag:

```
npm start -- -p 3000
```

Or edit the `start` script directly:

```
parcel index.html -p 3000
```

## Notes

### Babel transforms

The Babel preset [babel-preset-nano-react-app](https://github.com/nano-react-app/babel-preset-nano-react-app) is used to support the same transforms that Create React App supports.

The Babel configuration lives inside `package.json` and will override an external `.babelrc` file, so if you want to use `.babelrc` remember to delete the `babel` property inside `package.json`.
